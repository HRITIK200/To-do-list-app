# ✅ To-Do List Web App

## 📘 Project Overview
The **To-Do List App** is a responsive and interactive web-based task management tool built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to easily add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.  
The app also stores tasks in the **browser’s localStorage**, so data persists even after refreshing or reopening the page.

This project was developed as part of my **Web Development Internship** under **Unified Mentor** to practice front-end development and UI design skills.
