# ✅ To-Do List Web App

## 📘 Project Overview
The **To-Do List App** is a responsive and interactive web-based task management tool built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to easily add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.  
The app also stores tasks in the **browser’s localStorage**, so data persists even after refreshing or reopening the page.

This project was developed as part of my **Web Development Internship** under **Unified Mentor** to practice front-end development and UI design skills.

## Example Scenario

Let’s say you add these tasks:

“Complete README file” → Due: 2025-10-07 → Priority: High
“Design PPT slides” → Due: 2025-10-09 → Priority: Medium
“Email mentor for feedback” → Due: 2025-10-10 → Priority: Low

Your app will show them like this (each with color side indicators):

🔴 High = red border
🟠 Medium = orange
🟢 Low = green

You can now filter to see only pending, completed, or all tasks, and the counter will update automatically.
